Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

How to run the game:
Download the folder as .zip, unzip the folder and open index.html in your web browser.
When the page is loaded, the game is automatically started.

How to play the game:
The goal of the game is to reach the water on the other side of the road.
You can move the character with up, down, left, and right key.

When you get hit by the bugs, you have failed and will be brought back to the starting position.
When you reach the water, you have won and will be brought back to the starting position.

When you win, you earn 100 points. You can replay as many times as you want, to collect the highest score.
Once you lose, the score is reset to 0.
