Simple Arcade Game
===============================
A simple arcade game I created to practice JavaScript. The project was part of Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree from Udacity.

How to play the game
---------------------
The goal of the game is to reach the water on the other side of the road.
You can move the character with up, down, left, and right key.

When you get hit by the bugs, you have failed and will be brought back to the starting position.
When you reach the water, you have won and will be brought back to the starting position.

When you win, you earn 100 points. You can replay as many times as you want, to collect the highest score.
Once you lose, the score is reset to 0.
